Log:
5/1/19
Implemented stubs of subway_portal, subway_station, and subway_system. Makefile builds the executable.

5/2/19
Implemented subway_portal.

5/3/19
Implemented subway_station.

5/4/19
Started implementing subawy_system. Started with implementing add_portal and form_stations, which are called regardless of command_File's contents.

5/6/19
Finished add_portal, continued work on form_stations. Also implemented findstation and unionstations (adapted from chapter 8 notes).

5/7/19
Finished form_stations. Listallstations gives correct output. Started work on listallportals.

5/8/19
Finished listallportals, works correctly. Started work on nearest_routes and nearest_portal.

5/9/19
Finished nearest_portal, works correctly. Working on nearest_routes.

5/10/19
Finished implementing SubwaySystem and documenting code.

Notes:
The project took around 40 hours to complete (excluding the first part). Most of the time spent was towards subway_system's implementation. 

The methods findstation and unionstations were adapted from chapter 8's find and union method implementations.

nearest_portal finds the true closest portal from the given point. So it's output is different from two of the output files on eniac.

list_all_stations has a duplicate, but I am pretty sure its not a bug. More detail above its implementation.

listroutes lists some of the routes stations in a different order than eniacs outputfiles, though the same stations are printed regardless.
